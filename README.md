# What is Quotex Trading? A Comprehensive Guide for Indian Traders

## Introduction

Quotex is an online trading platform that allows users to trade digital
options on a wide range of assets, including currencies,
cryptocurrencies, commodities, and indices. Digital options are
short-term contracts where traders predict whether the price of an asset
will be higher or lower than the current price at the time of expiry. If
the trader\'s prediction is correct, they win a payout; if not, they
lose their investment.
